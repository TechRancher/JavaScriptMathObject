# JavaScriptMathObject

Welcome!
This was put together for me to just practice on JavaScript functions/methods to gain a deeper understanding. Feel free to check it out and see if any of it is helpful to you.

I am using W3School JavaScript Math Object functions/methods for practice.
There website for JavaScript Math Object is https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp
There website for JavaScript Tutroial is https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

I commented out the functions in the practice.js file, so in order to run them you must uncomment them.
I have it setup to run only one function at a time.
The index.html file is very basic that you can use with this to run the functions. It has a button which I have setup to run the functions.
I hope you find this helpful as it was for me.
